# bimug_drone
BIMUG_DRONE is a Python libray to process and analyse data recorded from a flying drone using an electronic set of devices called BIMUG, standing for Barometric, IMU, Gps.
This project is part of the subject Aerospace Laboratories developed during the Master's Degree in Space and Aeronautical
Engineering that I'm studiying at ESEIAAT - UPC (Univesitat Polit√©cnica de Catalunya) in Terassa (Barcelona).
